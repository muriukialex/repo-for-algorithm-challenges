/*
Story: 
A small frog wants to get to the other side of a river.
 The frog is initially located on one bank of the river (position 0)
  and wants to get to the opposite bank (position X+1). 
  Leaves fall from a tree onto the surface of the river.

  For example, you are given integer X = 5 and array A such that:
  A[0] = 1
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 4
  A[4] = 2
  A[5] = 3
  A[6] = 5
  A[7] = 4

In second 6, a leaf falls into position 5. 
This is the earliest time when leaves appear in every position
 across the river.

Write a function:

    function solution(X, A);

that, given a non-empty array A 
consisting of N integers and integer X, 
returns the earliest time when the frog can jump to the other side of the river.

If the frog is never able to jump to the other
 side of the river, the function should return âˆ’1.
